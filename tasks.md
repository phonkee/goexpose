# Tasks

## Convert to zap logger

This is necessary to get structured logging

## move tasks to package task

separate package for tasks

## cli urfave/cli

Introduce commands and subcommands

## better error reporting with validating config (also separate subtask)

Use go-response package

Use that instead of homebaked solution
